2.  **Generate an API Key**: Visit the API Keys page in the xAI Console to create your unique API key. This key is essential for authenticating your requests.
3.  **Make Your First Request**: Test the API using cURL or your preferred programming language to ensure everything is set up correctly.

## Code Examples for the Grok API

Here are some code examples to help you get started with the Grok API.

### Basic Text Completion with Python

```python
import os
from openai import OpenAI

XAI_API_KEY = os.getenv("XAI_API_KEY")
client = OpenAI(
    api_key=XAI_API_KEY,
    base_url="https://api.x.ai/v1",
)

completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="grok-2-latest",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": "You are Grok, a chatbot inspired by the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy."
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "What is the meaning of life, the universe, and everything?"
        },
    ],
)

print(completion.choices[0].message.content)
```

### Image Analysis with Python

```python
import os
from openai import OpenAI

XAI_API_KEY = os.getenv("XAI_API_KEY")
image_url = "https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/web-first-images-release.png"

client = OpenAI(
    api_key=XAI_API_KEY,
    base_url="https://api.x.ai/v1",
)

messages = [
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {
                "type": "image_url",
                "image_url": {
                    "url": image_url,
                    "detail": "high",
                },
            },
            {
                "type": "text",
                "text": "What's in this image?",
            },
        ],
    },
]

completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="grok-2-vision-latest",
    messages=messages,
    temperature=0.01,
)
print(completion.choices[0].message.content)
```

## Compatibility with Existing SDKs

The xAI API is designed for seamless compatibility with both OpenAI and Anthropic SDKs. Migrating your existing applications to Grok requires only minimal changes: updating the base URL, API key, and model name. This compatibility significantly reduces the learning curve and implementation time for developers already familiar with these popular AI platforms, making it easier to leverage Grok's advanced capabilities.

## Pricing and Token Usage for Grok Models

Grok models utilize a token-based pricing model. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the pricing structure:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Model</th>
      <th>Context Window</th>
      <th>Input Price (per million tokens)</th>
      <th>Output Price (per million tokens)</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>grok-2-1212</td>
      <td>131,072</td>
      <td>$2.00</td>
      <td>$10.00</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>grok-2-vision-1212</td>
      <td>32,768</td>
      <td>$2.00 (text), $2.00 (image)</td>
      <td>$10.00</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Understanding the token-based pricing model helps you optimize your usage and manage costs effectively.

## Key Considerations and Limitations When Using the Grok API

When integrating the Grok API into your applications, keep the following points in mind to ensure optimal performance and accuracy:

- **Knowledge Cutoff**: Grok-2-1212 models have a knowledge cutoff date of July 17, 2024. Ensure that your queries align with this timeframe for the most accurate responses.
- **No Realtime Access**: Unlike Grok.com and Grok in X, the API models are not connected to the internet and cannot access real-time information. Plan accordingly if your application requires up-to-date data.
- **Image Constraints**: For vision models, the maximum image size is 10MB, and supported formats are JPG/JPEG and PNG. Ensure your images meet these requirements to avoid errors.
- **Model Aliases**: Use the general model name (e.g., "grok-2") for the latest stable version, or add "-latest" for the cutting-edge release. This ensures you are using the appropriate model for your needs.

## Monitoring Usage and Consumption of Grok API Tokens

The xAI Console provides comprehensive usage monitoring tools, including a dedicated Usage Page for tracking token consumption. Each API response includes a detailed usage object showing prompt and completion token counts:

```json
"usage": {
    "prompt_tokens": 41,
    "completion_tokens": 87,
    "total_tokens": 128,
    "prompt_tokens_details": {
        "text_tokens": 41,
        "audio_tokens": 0,
        "image_tokens": 0,
        "cached_tokens": 0
    }
}
```

This detailed usage information helps you monitor and optimize your API usage, ensuring efficient resource management.
