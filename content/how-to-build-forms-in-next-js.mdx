## Introduction

Building forms in Next.js has evolved significantly with React 19's introduction of new features like `useActionState`. In this guide, we'll explore how to create professional-grade forms with proper loading states, server actions, and user feedback. We'll focus on creating a product creation form that demonstrates these concepts in action.

## Understanding useActionState

The `useActionState` hook is a powerful new feature in React 19 that simplifies form handling. It returns an array with three important elements:

1. **Current State**: Initially set to the provided initial state. After form submission, it's updated to the action's return value.
2. **Form Action**: A new action function to be passed to the form's `action` prop.
3. **Pending State**: A boolean indicating whether the form submission is processing.

Here's how it works in practice:

```jsx
const [state, submitAction, isPending] = useActionState(
  async (currentState, formData) => {
    // currentState: Contains the previous state
    // formData: The form data being submitted
    const result = await processForm(formData);
    return result; // This becomes the new state
  },
  null // Initial state
);
```

## Setting Up Server Actions

First, let's create our server action for handling form submissions. Create a new file `actions/addProduct.js`:

```jsx
"use server";

import { revalidatePath } from "next/cache";

const addProduct = async (formData) => {
  try {
    // Validate form data
    const productName = formData.get("productName");
    const price = formData.get("price");
    const description = formData.get("description");

    if (!productName || !price || !description) {
      return {
        success: false,
        message: "All fields are required",
        status: "error",
      };
    }

    // Simulate API call
    await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));

    // Revalidate the products page
    revalidatePath("/products");

    return {
      success: true,
      message: "Product added successfully",
      status: "success",
    };
  } catch (error) {
    return {
      success: false,
      message: "Failed to add product",
      status: "error",
    };
  }
};

export default addProduct;
```

## Building the Form Component

Now, let's create our form component using shadcn/ui components and React 19's `useActionState`. Create a new file `app/products/new/page.jsx`:

```jsx
"use client";

import { useActionState } from "react";
import { useToast } from "@/hooks/use-toast";
import addProduct from "@/actions/addProduct";
import {
  Card,
  CardContent,
  CardDescription,
  CardHeader,
  CardTitle,
} from "@/components/ui/card";
import { Input } from "@/components/ui/input";
import { Label } from "@/components/ui/label";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

export default function NewProductPage() {
  const { toast } = useToast();
  const [state, submitAction, isPending] = useActionState(
    async (currentState, formData) => {
      const result = await addProduct(formData);

      if (result.status === "error") {
        toast({
          variant: "destructive",
          title: "Error",
          description: result.message,
        });
      } else {
        toast({
          title: "Success",
          description: result.message,
        });
      }

      return result;
    },
    null
  );

  return (
    <Card className="w-full max-w-md mx-auto">
      <CardHeader>
        <CardTitle>Create Product</CardTitle>
        <CardDescription>Enter your product information below</CardDescription>
      </CardHeader>
      <CardContent>
        <form action={submitAction} className="space-y-4">
          <div className="space-y-2">
            <Label htmlFor="productName">Product Name</Label>
            <Input
              id="productName"
              name="productName"
              placeholder="Enter product name"
              className={state?.errors?.productName ? "border-red-500" : ""}
            />
          </div>

          <div className="space-y-2">
            <Label htmlFor="price">Price</Label>
            <Input
              id="price"
              name="price"
              type="number"
              placeholder="0.00"
              min="0"
              step="0.01"
            />
          </div>

          <div className="space-y-2">
            <Label htmlFor="description">Description</Label>
            <Input
              id="description"
              name="description"
              placeholder="Product description"
            />
          </div>

          <Button type="submit" className="w-full" disabled={isPending}>
            {isPending ? "Adding Product..." : "Add Product"}
          </Button>
        </form>
      </CardContent>
    </Card>
  );
}
```

## How to Show Pending State on Button

One of the key advantages of using `useActionState` is the built-in pending state handling. The hook provides an `isPending` boolean that we can use to show loading states in our UI. Here's how we implement it on our submit button:

```jsx
<Button
  type="submit"
  className="w-full"
  disabled={isPending} // Disable button during submission
>
  {isPending ? "Adding Product..." : "Add Product"} // Change button text based
  on state
</Button>
```

This creates a better user experience by:

1. Disabling the button during form submission to prevent double submissions
2. Showing a loading message to indicate the action is in progress
3. Re-enabling the button once the action is complete

## Implementing Toast Notifications

We're using shadcn/ui's toast component for displaying notifications. Make sure you have the toast provider set up in your layout:

```jsx
// app/layout.jsx
import { Toaster } from "@/components/ui/toaster";

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        {children}
        <Toaster />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

## Best Practices and Error Handling

Here are some key features and best practices we've implemented:

1. **State Management**: Using `useActionState` for form state handling
2. **Loading States**: Clear pending state indication during form submission
3. **User Feedback**: Toast notifications for success and error states
4. **Form Validation**: Server-side validation with error messages
5. **UI Components**: Leveraging shadcn/ui for consistent design
6. **Accessibility**: Proper labels and ARIA attributes
7. **Error Boundaries**: Proper error handling and user feedback

## Conclusion

In this guide, we've built a modern form handling system in Next.js using React 19's latest features. The combination of Server Actions, `useActionState`, and shadcn/ui components creates a powerful and user-friendly form experience. This approach provides:

- Efficient state management with `useActionState`
- Clear loading states during form submission
- Server-side processing with Server Actions
- Beautiful UI components with shadcn/ui
- Accessible form elements
- Clear user feedback with toast notifications
